Thymeleaf Review: 

Template Engine: It is used to display data in the view that the controller sends. 

Thymeleaf : it provides the good support serving HTML5 in web application. 
To integrate thymeleaf with springboot we need to add: spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf
and then to convert the html file to thymeleaf, we need to add the attribute xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"

Thymeleaf components: 

1- Displaying values:
	th:text is used to display the value of the model attributes
	and to access the attribute we need to use ${attribute_key}. This exp is used to refer to any of the attributes we send from controller


@Controller
@RequestMapping("/car")
public class CarController{
	
	@RequestMapping("/info")
	public String carInfo(Model model){

		Listing<String> cars = Arrays.asList("Honda","Toyota","Tesla");
		model.addAttribute("cars",cars);


	 return "car/car-info";
	}


car-info.html:


	<h2 th:text="${cars.get(0)}"></h2>


Links:  @{....} is used to create URLs

	Absolute URLS : <a th:href="@{http://www.cydeo.com">Cydeo</a>

	Relative URLs : <a th:href="@{/car/buy/"}>Buy a Car</a>


	Adding Parameters to Link:  <a th:href="@{car/buy/(year=2019)}"></a> ---> .../car/buy?year=2019


Iteration:  th:each is used to achieve iteration


<ul>
	<li th:each="car : ${cars}"   th:text="${car}"   >

</ul>












}
