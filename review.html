Hello <span>Cihan</span>,<br /><br />How are you doing? Hope you had a great start to the New Year!<br /><br />I am checking in as per the Review schedule even though there have been no sessions completed.<br /><br />Student demand should pick up this week as schools start to reopen after the break. I have included some <strong>tips on getting sessions and signing up for shifts</strong>:<br />i) New tutors get access to the scheduling calendar every Friday at noon ET. In addition to this, new tutors get first access to the calendar on the first Wednesday of every month alongside the higher-level tutors. Be sure to mark this on your calendar and take advantage of this opportunity!<br />ii) Additional hours can be added on at noon ET on Saturdays if they are available.<br />iii) If you prefer to float, the peak demand hours (5-11 pm ET, Sunday-Thursday) are the times when you are most likely to be connected to students.<br />iv) Have you signed up for floating tutor notifications? This is a great way to be notified in real-time when there are students in your subjects waiting for tutors and none are immediately available. You can set this up in your account settings.<br />v) Are there other subjects you are interested in tutoring? Take additional subject exams and once you pass, send a line to Tutor Support so the new subject may be added to your account. The more subjects you are approved to tutor, the greater your chances of being connected to students.<br /><br />You will continue to hear from me once every 9-11 days until you resume tutoring. I am here to help and support you during your orientation period so please feel free to email me any time you have questions or concerns.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing sessions in your account soon.<br /><br />All the best,<br />Madhu.<br />madhu.trasi@tutor.com
